          subtitle: "With a background in computer science and software engineering, I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor 
          at Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology (SSUET), Karachi, Pakistan. Before joining SSUET, I have served as 
          Assistant Professor at the Ziauddin University in Karachi, Pakistan for two years. Prior to joining Ziauddin University, 
          I held the position of Senior AI Developer at HetroCloud, a research project funded by 
          the National Center of Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC) that was executed at the Karachi Institute of Economics and Technology (KIET). 
          My expertise in machine learning and computer vision spans over five years, and I have contributed to several peer‑reviewed articles 
          published in renowned conferences and journals such as Elsevier Pattern Recognition Letters, Elsevier 
          Computer Networks, Springer Neural Processing Letters, IEEE Access, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information 
          Systems, and IEEE TENCON. In 2017, I received the HEC Indigenous Ph.D. Fellowship in recognition of my academic 
          achievements to pursue doctoral studies. My research interests lie in Matrix Factorization, Network Tomography, 
          ill‑posed problems, radial basis function neural networks, computer vision and deep learning. Additionally, I have 
          served as a reviewer for the Elsevier journals Computer Networks and Results in Control and Optimization."
